<p style="color: black; font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Breaking News:    Crazed Man Murder's Wife</p>

<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">Just last night a man named Marcus Maverick murdered his wife in their city home, and entombed her in a cellar wall.</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">Police reports claim that Marcus taunted them by proclaiming the structural soundness of the house, going as far</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">as to tap the wall in which his wife, Minnie Maverick, was encased behind. However, this taunting would prove to</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">be his own undoing. Police reports say that after Marcus tapped the wall with his cane, a "discordant screeching</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">erupted from the wall". Upon hearing this, police tore down the wall only to reveal the Maverick's cat sitting</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">atop the corpse of Minnie, covered in her blood.</p>

<br>
    
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">Upon seeing this, Marcus began yelling incoherent claims regarding the cat. As Marcus was carried out of his house,</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">neighbors reported hearing him claim that "This damned cat is the spawn of satan," and "I didn't kill Minnie.</p>
<p style="color: black; font-size: 19px;">This creature caused everything."</p>
