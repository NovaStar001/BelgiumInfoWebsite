<h1 style="color:#000000; font-size:28px;">Organs</h1>

<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Heart</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The heart is an organ that resides in the chest, that contracts to pump blood through a series of veins and arteries throughout the body. Despite popular belief, the heart is not kept in pace by the brain, but rather a series of pacemaker cells in the heart.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Stomach</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The stomach is located just below the left lung, with connections to the esophagus and the small intestine. The stomach contains enzymes which can break down food for digestion.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Liver</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The liver is positioned across the body from the stomach, being just below the right lung. In its simplest form, the liver detoxifies the body. In a more in depth form, the liver filters blood from toxins and other waste products, that are eventually removed from the body through urine or fecal matter.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Kidney</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The kidneys are located near the spine, and just below the ribs. The kidneys, similar to the liver, filter blood. The difference comes from the specialization of the kidneys, the kidneys remove waste exclusively through urine. Kidneys have the added functionality of maintaining blood pressure.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Esophagus</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The esophagus is located in the neck, below the windpipe. The esophagus transports food from the mouth to the stomach.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Small Intestine</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The small intestine is located in the abdomen, connecting to the stomach. The small intestine digests ~95% of all nutrients the body ingests.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Large Intestine</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The large intestine is located in the abdomen, connecting to the small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes, in addition to producing fecal matter.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Diaphragm</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The diaphragm is located below the lungs and the heart. The diaphram contracts to create a vacuum in the lungs, and relaxes to compress them.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Spleen</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The spleen is located behind the left set of ribs. The spleen contains white blood cells, used for fighting invading bacteria. Additionally, the spleen filters the blood. Due to the large workload of the liver, the human body can survive without the spleen.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Lungs</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The lungs are located behind the ribs. The lungs expand to pull in oxygen, which is then introduced to the circulatory system.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Hair</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">Hair is located in many spaces on the body. Hair can serve a few purposes, but the most common use of hair is to regulate body temperature.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Skin</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">Skin is wrapped around every part of the body (with the exception of some points like the eyes). The skin serves many purposes, most of which being defense against "the elements" (I.E. UV light, or harmful bacteria).</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Brain</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">The brain is located within the skull. The brain can be thought of as the "control center" of a human. It operates on a series of Â±120 neruotransmitters, across 100,000,000,000 neurons. For comparison, a standard CPU has ~20,000,000,000 transistors, which can hold two states.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:#000000; font-size:22px;">Eye</p>
<p style="color:#black; font-size:16px;">Eyes are located in pockets on the front of the skull. The eyes aren't the only source of optical signals for the brain, some studies have stated that blind individuals still have the ability to visualize their environments through other senses.</p>
